# 619.(Easy) Biggest Single Number


Find the biggest number that only appears once.

```
my_numbers

+---+
|num|
+---+
| 8 |
| 8 |
| 3 |
| 3 |
| 1 |
| 4 |
| 5 |
| 6 | 

+---+
|num|
+---+
| 6 |
```

为什么这里必须套一个subquery.. 
为什么直接SELECT MAX()选不出最大值..

```sql
SELECT MAX(num) num
FROM (
    SELECT num
    FROM my_numbers
    GROUP BY num
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
) t
```
